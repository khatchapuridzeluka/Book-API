# ðŸ“š Book Management API

This API supports basic CRUD operations for managing books using **SQL Server** and **Entity Framework**. It uses **Swagger** for API documentation and testing.

## Features

- **Authentication**:  
  To interact with the API, login using the following credentials and get the JWT token:
  - **Username**: `Exadel`

- **CRUD Operations**:
  - **Add a Book** (single/bulk)
  - **Update a Book** (single)
  - **Soft Delete a Book** (single/bulk)
  - **Retrieve Book Titles** (list)
  - **Retrieve Book Details** (returns detailed info with a popularity score calculated on the fly)

- **Validations**:
  - `bookDTO` requires:
